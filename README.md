# Face-mask-detection
COVID-19 has made wearing a face mask mandatory in public places including banks, churches, mosques, malls, restaurants, and grocery shops. We developed a face mask detection system that can reliably determine whether or not someone is wearing a mask. Having a staff personally inspect each person to ensure their mask is on misses the purpose of minimizing human interaction as much as possible. As a result, a real-time face mask identification system may be employed to address this problem, which will not only increase efficiency but may even save lives. This model may be utilized in a variety of real-life scenarios when wearing a face mask is required.
